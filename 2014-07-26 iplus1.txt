well, everything works now. I guess I`m done?

I`m just going to stay at exporting to .csv. after looking further into .apkg stuff, it doesnt really seem to offer anything useful.

The code for the pytoeba side is also complete, so this is ready once that is.

The web interface stuff will probably need to be redone once the actual site is up, but thats a bit out of my control right now so I guess thats what my filler-ish page is for.
