title: iplus1

ok so I added a bunch of languages to libiplus1, and it turns out iplus1d takes up a lot of memory. like, over 1gb.

In test runs, loading two languages took about 40s, while loading the 13 takes about two minutes


Depending on the hardware, it might be better to just have iplus1c load the two languages on demand and parse them.
requires further testing (and finding out hardware specs)
