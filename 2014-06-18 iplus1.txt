ok so I did this totally pro thing

in sets, redis can optimize a string if it is a number that fits in 64bytes.
so for links, I combine the two 32 bit ids into a single 64 bit int and store it.
memory usage is at 75mb
I am pretty much dendi right now.

so right now links are:
SADD <lang1>-<lang2> <(id1 | id2 << 32)>
where lang1 and lang2 are sorted alphabetically so I dont have to have eng-jpn and jpn-eng that replicate the exact same data.

still takes like, 3 hours to parse though.
