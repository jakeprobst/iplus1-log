ok new approach: moving from tons of reallocs to linked lists really sped up the initial parsing (like, twice as fast (while also taking up even more memory, I did not think it would take up so much when I came up with this plan)).
so I`m gonna try and have iplus1c do all the work.
I`ll split sentences.csv into a file per language for quick loading.
since sentences.csv updates once per week, I could optimize this even more and just pre-parse the sentences.


iplus1c -n eng -t jpn -i collection.anki
-n is the native language, -t is target language, -i is input anki deck
later there will be a -o flag to specify output file, but for now just write to stdout.
