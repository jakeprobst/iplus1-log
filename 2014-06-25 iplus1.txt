so, iplu1d can accept anki data and send back data.

now I have to work on the user-facing bit.
the server doesn't seem equipped to handle having anki collections uploaded and parsed, so need to find an alternative.
idea 1: parse the file locally through javascript
	there is an sqlite javascript library, but it is quite large and probably slow on older systems.
	might make a proof of concept and try on my shitty netbook and see how well it works.
	send to server through an api which sends the data to iplus1d
idea 2: parse locally pt.2 
	have the user export to a text file and parse that through javascript
idea 3: export to apkg and upload that
	anki apkgs are quite small and possibly might not be much of a load on the server
idea 4: anki plugin
	this one feels like sort of a cop-out to me. makes it feel like less of a tatoeba thing? I dunno.
	would be significantly easier to do though
	will probably have this whether a browser interface exists or not
