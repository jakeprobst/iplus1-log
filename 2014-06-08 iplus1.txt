I found a really quick way to parse everything:

preparefiles.py does a bit more work than it used to. it takes about 30s to run (and will only need to be ran when sentences.csv updates).
it separates all the languages into their own files, and now puts the translation of a sentence next to it:
"102048	jpn	彼は長身の人であった。	eng:He was a tall man.	pol:Był wysokim człowiekiem."
so no more searching around in links to find the id we want then searching through the sentence list again.

iplus1c currently outputs something like:
"'彼は長身の人であった。' -> 'He was a tall man.': ['長身']"


it takes under 5 seconds and ~80mb of ram to parse my anki deck, check all sentences for new words, and print them.

I guess the iplus1d code is now obsolete and I should probably trash it.

now to figure out .apkg formats.

usage:
./iplus1c -n eng -t jpn -i ~/Anki/jake/collection.anki2
