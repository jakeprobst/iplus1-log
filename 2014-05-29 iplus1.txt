* get stemming working in english parser
* get sentence+collections working


I figured out how I wanted to code all the stuff while I was laying in bed trying to sleep, and of course now I don`t remember what it was.

==explanation==
libiplus1 loads the tatoeba database into an iplus1_collection_t
iplus1d puts the user's sentences into an iplus1_collection_t
(iplus1c reads the .anki and sends the data to iplus1d)

iplus1_collection_diff


==code==
iplus1_collection_t main_db;
iplus1_collection_t anki_deck;

/* add sentences to both */

iplus1_list_t new_sen = iplus1_collection_diff(main_db, anki_deck);


for(i = new_sen; i != NULL; i = i->next) {
	/* do magic */
}



Another idea is a callback:

int do_magic(char* str, int len, char** words)
{


}

iplus1_collection_diff(main_db, anki_deck, &do_magic);

that way it can stop after X results without having to parse everything
