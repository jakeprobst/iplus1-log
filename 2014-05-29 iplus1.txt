* get stemming working in english parser
* get sentence+collections working


I figured out how I wanted to code all the stuff while I was laying in bed trying to sleep, and of course now I don`t remember what it was.

iplus1_collection_t main_db;
iplus1_collection_t anki_deck;

/* add sentences to both */

iplus1_list_t new_sen = iplus1_collection_diff(main_db, anki_deck);


for(i = new_sen; i != NULL; i = i->next) {
	/*  */
}



Another idea is a callback:
