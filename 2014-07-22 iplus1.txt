ok TI4 is over backtowork

got the browser to POST the data to the server and have it send appropriate data back.
except, I don't have the database, so I just send back filler text for now.
I`ll probably shove the text db into redis to be able to have a test server running for people to try out. that`ll take like a day to fully insert though...

actually, it turned out to be fast.
so I have a working demo, it just shows sentence pairs and doesn't put them in a usable format though.
