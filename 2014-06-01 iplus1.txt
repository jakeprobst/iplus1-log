* try and figure a way to filter out nouns.



All my shit got derailed yesterday when I tried to find something to filter out the proper nouns in sentences. All the named entity recognition stuff seems to either be in python or java.
Might just compile a list of proper nouns and have it check against that. Like, have a separate script that goes through the db and pulls out all the nouns.
Solution: yell at lool0 to add fields in the database where users can specify the proper nouns in a sentence so I can ignore them. Or if he doesn't, then I will. Seems like a much easier solution that also allows for greater accuracy.
