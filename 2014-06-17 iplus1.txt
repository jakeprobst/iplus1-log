ok so redis format idea two:

HSET <lang> <id> <tokens>
tokens being <token 1>,<token 2>,<token 3>

HSET <tlang>-<nlang> <id> <tid>

ok so ankidata is all loaded up tokenized for words and now we ask redis for ids of all sentences of the target lang that have native lang translations
iterate over list of sentences -> get tokens based on id -> check tokens against list of words from anki deck -> find sentences with one new -> save tid -> return list of tids to server for it to look up and send to user.

as an optimization, <tlang>-<nlang> and <nlang>-<tlang> would both exist and be the same thing mostly.
sort it alphabetically so that the pair will have one list total and make a note which side is needed to look up the translation we need.
also makes it easier to send data as a pair will just need to be sent once (current links.csv has all links both ways).



and for protocol:
LNK\t<lang code>\t<id>\t<lang code>\t<id>
